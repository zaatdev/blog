# Coronavirus’ Impact on Business - Save Yours!

Coronavirus has brought the global economy to a sudden shock, and its consequences have  reached the businesses in the service sector. Until this moment, many business owners are wondering what recovery could look like!

In response, many companies and business owners decided to cut down wages, lay off their employees, and/or to shift their operations online.

Fortunately, some coronavirus consequences for business can be prevented by the use of technologies.

## Technology Against Coronavirus
Technology can’t stop the pandmeic, however it can help prevent the spread, warn, and educate people to be aware of the situation, noticeably lessening the impact and force them to follow the social-distancing rules.

Out of sudden, technology matters to everyone on business more than ever before. Major businesses across all sectors were able to create remote-working strategies in days. Also, they were able to develop a long-term transformation strategy based on technology decisions.

This pandemic has proven that businesses can use digital services to help employees work from any location in the longer term. This is what we can call; creating a lasting technology-led change.

## Save Your Business

During the pandemic, all retail stores and shopping malls closed, which means not only there is no money coming in, but also they have to keep up with expenses such as merchandise storage and other costs. Here, technology plays a vital role in such an area, by turning traditional business to an online business. So, by going online, your business will have online presence which will increase potential customers and revenues or sales, and decrease administrative costs. Where the most important thing is you will be providing a contactless purchase service. 

Many businesses have adopted an online work culture, the nonpartisan think tank, the Conference Board, [conducted a survey](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/03/remote-work-will-be-legacy-of-pandemic-conference-board-survey-finds.html/) and found that before COVID-19, 77% of companies had less than 10% of employees working from home. Now, that number is expected to increase by 30%, and it will be challenging the technology sector to keep things running smoothly into the new normal.

Nevertheless, Life does not have to be on hold, just because you are under the coronavirus quarantine! You should continue to work remotely and maintain the digital side of your business during the COVID-19 pandemic. So, here are some ways and tools that you could use to handle your remote work operation;

* ### Virtual Meeting Platforms
  We are all familiar with technologies like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) for virtual meetings would definitely help you apply the precautionary plan you need at your business. Also, Google offers [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/), which recently became free, allows you to safely create and join high-quality video meetings.

  It is interesting how this pandemic supercharged a battle between conferencing software platforms, as we see, Skype (acquired by Microsoft) has lost its crown to Zoom. And Microsoft now is competing with Slack over the workplace communication apps.

* ### Collaboration and Communication Applications
  When you manage or work on a remote team, you need an efficient way to communicate. So, you can benefit from popular workspaces such as [Slack](http://slack.com) or [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). With both being at the top of the workspace market.

  Both Slack and Microsoft Teams are made up of channels, which are the conversations you have with your teammates. Each channel is dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project. Also, they offer fairly similar features you need, such like; storage, integrated apps, video conferencing and more.

  There is also [Discord](https://discord.com), even though it is branded as a way for gamers to talk while playing, it is gaining popularity among small and startup businesses. Discord might not be the ideal app for work, because of some limitations like; DMs are universal,no message threading, and limited file uploads, but might be worth a shot.

* ### Time Tracking and Productivity Management Tool
  There are some smart tools that will help you in managing the operation time of your employees. Such as, [Time Doctor](https://www.timedoctor.com) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so) both will help you to face one of your biggest fears in managing the time and the activity of your employees who are working remotely.

* ### Task Management Software
  [Trello](https://trello.com) is a task management software where employees use to sort out their daily/weekly tasks with timelines and durations, by using it, it would be assured that every team member would finish their task on time as if they’re in the office. Also, [Github](https://github.com) has a [project management feature](https://github.com/features/project-management/) which allows your team members to work together more cohesively to quickly and thoroughly complete projects. There is also [Asana](https://asana.com), which is a task manager software to keep track of individual and team tasks and get them done faster.

* ### Build a Web-Based App
  Web applications deliver many benefits to your business especially in the pandemic, including reducing business costs, remaining productivity high, enhancing your professional brand, and improving your customer service.
  
  So, If your business sells tangible goods, such as; clothes, food, grocery items, etc. you can save your business and fight the spread of coronavirus whilst also maintaining your clients’ health by getting an efficient and on demand delivery app development solution that meets your clients’ demand. Furthermore, if your company has an appointment-based business model, you definitely should have an online booking system to minimise physical contact, also to keep staff and visitors safe and implement social distancing.
  
  In general, web based applications can do magic under the current pandemic, and there are small and big app developers creating software helping to adjust the new work environment.
